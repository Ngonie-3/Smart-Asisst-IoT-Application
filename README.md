# IoT-Application
This Project creates an android application which controls home appliances by either voice command or using the application itself, whereby 
the appliances being controlled are a light bulb and fan. The application supports two languages which are German and English, that is commands 
to control the application can be issued in both languages and the application will respond accordingly. 
The aid of a Rapsberry pi card and a two-relay channel arduino module was used to connect the gpio pins to their respective channel, which will 
then enable the light and fan to either switch on or off.
